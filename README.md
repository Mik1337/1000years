# Hello, fellow "humans"

This message is for those reading this in a 1000 years.
If you're reading this, then you are probably using some "retro" device and a translator that converts "classical" english to whatever ungodly meme you use now.

So, here's what I want you to ask yourself,
* Have you the stars lately ? 
* Are the skies just as polluted as they are now ? 
* Have you met aliens ?
* Is your technology sufficiently advanced enough for us to consider it magic ?
* Is your society so advanced that they recognise the fallacies of "human" nature ?

I honestly don't think "humans" in a 1000 years would be any different from what they are now.
The essence of humanity is to believe they are at the pinnacle of technology and forget the wisdom of the past...
If you are any different than "us", that's great but I hope to "god" (if that term is still in use) that you lot have a cure for random headaches and instant teleportation,
and like, weighted blankets that purr lol.

# Life in 2020
Life in 2020 is v weird lol, im 21 and i've lived though a 1 millenium, 1 centurly, 2 decades but 2020 is the wildest of 'em all.
What is currently known as China has what is now known as a "corona" virus, Australia is on fire, there's a volcano erupting somewhere and political leaders are v fiesty.
Apart fromt that, it's all meh.

# About me
If I make it to some weird history textbook of the future, all you need to know about me is that my real name isn't
Namikaze Mik (lastname firstname). Im 21 as of 2020 and I am, a nihilistic sloth.
I gave up my personhood to become an abstract concept.
My room is an art gallary and Im the master piece.
I watch a lot of anime and I love cats and sleeping.
I'd be okey with it if you represent me with a cat drawing (enclosed below)

This is a self portrait I had an artist who goes by the name of [violentli](https://www.instagram.com/violentli/) make for me.

I wish this was longer but it isn't because that's all there is to say that I can think of right now.
I postponed writing this and I don't have time to think of something cool lol. (If you relate to this and are shocked that you can relate to this, then I was right about you forgetting about the wisdom of the past.)

Okay, you can stop reading my hekkin (that's a meme word) repo and go eat u nerd.

### With Love
Your ancestor
